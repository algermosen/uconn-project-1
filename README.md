### Project Proposal: Analysis of Paxlovid Access and Affordability across Insurance Types

The objective of this project is to explore how access to Paxlovid, a key antiviral treatment, has evolved over the last four years, particularly focusing on differences in purchase ability between individuals covered by Medicare and those with private insurance. We will analyze variations in insurance pricing, coverage, and out-of-pocket costs among three insurance types (Medicare and two private options). This analysis will help uncover how these factors have affected different segments of the population, providing insight into broader implications for healthcare equity and affordability.

### List of Requirements:

- __Insurance Price Variation Dataset Analysis:__ Examine how Paxlovid prices vary based on insurance type.
- __Insurance Coverage Comparison:__ Compare coverage options among Medicare and two selected private insurance providers.
- __Out-of-Pocket Cost Analysis:__ Assess how insurance type has affected the out-of-pocket expenses for patients.
- __Impact on Population Segments:__ Investigate how these financial dynamics have influenced healthcare access for individuals across various demographics.
